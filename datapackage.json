	"title": "Quantitative data from EDSA demand analysis",
	"description": "This dataset provides the raw anonymised (quantitative) data from the EDSA demand analysis. This data has been gathered from surveys performed with those who identify as data scientists and manages of data scientists in different sectors across Europe.<br/><br/>The coverage of the data includes level of current expertise of the individual or team (data scientist and manager respectively) in eight key areas. The dataset also includes the importance of the eight key areas as capabilities of a data scientist. Further the dataset includes a breakdown of key tools, technologies and training delivery methods required to enhance the skill set of data scientists across Europe.<br/><br/>The <a href='http://davetaz.github.io/EDSA/survey_stats/' target='_blank'>EDSA dashboard</a> provides an interactive view of this dataset and demonstrates how it is being used within the project.<br/><br/>The dataset forms part of the European Data Science Academy (EDSA) project which received funding from the European Unions's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 643937. This three year project ran/runs from February 2015 to January 2018.<br/><br/><b>Important note on privacy:</b> This dataset has been collected and made available in a pseudo anonymous way, as agreed by participants. This means that while each record represents a person, no sensitive identifiable information, such as name, email or affiliation is available (we don't even collect it). Pseudo anonymisation is never full proof, however the projects <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fyv_uqWhxDg3-HSA7NqxdWN1Wd7tx6VRedLf-xud6Ic/edit?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>privacy impact assessment</a> has concluded that the risk resulting from the de-anonymisation of the data is extremely low. It should be noted that data is not included of participants who did not explicitly agree that it could be shared pseudo anonymously (this was due to a change of terms after the survey had started gathering responses, meaning any early responses had come from people who didn't see this clause).
